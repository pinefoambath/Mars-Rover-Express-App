# Mars Rover Express app

## What this is
This Express app shows you the most recent images that were sent back by NASA's Mars rovers. You can select a rover, and then will see the most recent image it had sent back to Earth. The app connects to the NASA API. Happy browsing!

## How to run this

- Clone the repo locally
- Install dependencies by running `yarn install`
- You'll need a NASA developer API key. You can get one here: https://api.nasa.gov/.
- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Store your API key in there (as in API_KEY=YourKey)
- Run `yarn start` in your terminal & enjoy interacting with the dashboard on `http:localhost:3000`

## Why I made this
I made this app to practice functional programming in JavaScript, learn about Express and Node.js.
